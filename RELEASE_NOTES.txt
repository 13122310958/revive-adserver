   database tables.


Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with OpenX ${RELEASE_VERSION}. Please
read this before reporting any new bugs.

 * OpenX ${RELEASE_VERSION} does NOT work with MySQL 3.x. If you are running
   OpenX 2.0 on this very old version of MySQL, do NOT attempt to upgrade,
   as your installation will no longer work correctly.

 * The recovery process will not work when MySQL is configured to use
   case-insensitive table names. For this reason, installation and upgrade
   is currently prevented when MySQL is configured this way.

   If your version of MySQL has "lower_case_table_name != 0", please see
   https://developer.openx.org/ticket/901 for more information.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "oa__"). You should NOT install
   OpenX with a prefix of this format.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See the FAQ
   [http://www.openx.org/support/faq.html] for more information if you have
   a large database.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP
   [http://docs.openx.org/openads-${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR}-guide/administrator-settings.html].

 * See https://developer.openx.org/ for the latest bug reports.


FAQ
---

 1. What can I do to help?

    We need help from developers and the testing community to provide as much
    feedback as possible to make OpenX even better. Please read these notes
    and how to report a bug [https://developer.openx.org/wiki/ReportingBugs]
    before reporting any bugs. You can also give us your feedback through the
    OpenX forum [http://forum.openx.org/].

 2. Can I upgrade from phpAdsNew?

    Yes.  phpAdsNew was rebranded as OpenX 2.0. You will need to ensure you
    first upgrade to the latest version of OpenX 2.0 before using the Openads
    ${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR} upgrade wizard.

 3. Where do I go for support?

    Support is provided through the OpenX forum [http://forum.openx.org/].
    In this way, we hope that the whole community benefits from the answers
    given.

 4. Where's the source code?

    You can access the OpenX source code using subversion. See our developer
    website [https://developer.openx.org/].
