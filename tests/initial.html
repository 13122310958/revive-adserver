    <h2>Openads 2.5-dev Testing Suite</h2>
    <p>
      In order to run tests, please copy the test.conf.php file in the
      Openads /etc directory into the Openads /var directory, and edit the file,
      so that it contains your database server details, and your webpath
      access details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please also ensure that the web server user has permission to write
      to the Openads /var and Openads /var/plugins directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also need to give your web server user permission to write
      to the Openads /tests/results directory if you want to run the visualisation
      tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEAR PHPUnit tests require that an appropriate version of
      a href="http://phpunit.de/" target="_blank">PHPUnit</a> be installed
      (e.g. PHPUnit 3.0 for using with PHP5, or PHPUnit 1.3.2 for PHP4) using PEAR,
      and each test may require additional configuration to run. See the appropriate
      PEAR library directory inside the Openads install for details.

      The Pear 'tests' directories should be writeable.

      For Pear::MDB2 and Pear::MDB2_Schema you should do the following:

      Copy test_setup.php.dist to test_setup.php in the Pear tests directory.

      For Pear::MDB2_Schema you should do the following:

      Open the test_setup.php for editing and enter your database user details for each installed DBMS that you have and uncomment the appropriate "#$dbarray[] = " lines.
      Also uncomment the section that requires MDB2_Schema and sets up the test datase.
