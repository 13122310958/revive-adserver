                                       with an the example template);
                                     - DOM is able to capture the text inside an HTML element or the

                                       each variables.
                                    When choosing DOM or Custom there is no need to modify the
                                    invocation code already deployed when variables change.
                                    Also, appending other MAX tracker codes to a tracker now
                                    makes sure that the same variable value is passed to the other
