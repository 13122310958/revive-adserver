this site for the latest available details on how to upgrade. However, for
convenience, the upgrade process is essentially:

1) Copy your existing installation directory to a backup location.

2) Take a backup of your existing installation's database, and check that it
   is a valid backup that you can restore.

3) Remove your existing installation directory.

4) Unpack the new version of Revive Adserver into the same directory name as
   your previous installation.

5) Copy your config files (i.e. all *.conf.php files) from the backup location
   to the var/ directory of the newly unpacked installation.

6) Use a web browser to visit your Revive Adserver site, and follow the
   instructions in the upgrade wizard to complete the upgrade.
