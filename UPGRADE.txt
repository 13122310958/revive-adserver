Upgrading
=========

Complete details of how to upgrade your existing `installation can be
found at http://docs.openx.org/. You should check this site for the latest
available details on how to upgrade. However, for convenience, the upgrade
process is essentially:
 
1) Create a new directory with the same directory name as your previous 
   installation, but add '_newfiles' to the end of the directory name, 
   (e.g. directoryname_newfiles);

2) Unpack the new version of `into this new directory;

3) Copy your config file from the current working location to the var/ directory 
   of the newly unpacked installation - read about config files in previous 
   versions of Openads, MMM or PhpAdsNew 
   (http://docs.openx.org/openads-2.3-guide/copying-openads-upgrade.html#configfilesupgrade);

4) Rename your existing working installation directory by adding '_backup' to 
   the end of the directory name, (e.g. directoryname_backup);

5) Rename 'directoryname_newfiles' by removing the '_newfiles' from the 
   directory name;

6) Use a web browser to visit your `site and follow the instructions in 
   the upgrade wizard to complete the upgrade.
