$conf = $GLOBALS['_MAX']['CONF'];
$name = (!empty($GLOBALS['_MAX']['PREF']['name'])) ? $GLOBALS['_MAX']['PREF']['name'] : MAX_PRODUCT_NAME;
$varprefix = $conf['var']['prefix'];

$words = array(
    'Remove Comments Note' => "
<!-- NOTE: You can remove the (extensive) comments when moving this code
         to a live server to reduce the size of your pages
-->",

    'Publisher JS Channel Script Comment 1' => "
<!-- {$name} Channel Script

   Generated with {$name} v" . OA_VERSION . "

   Include this script directly ABOVE the {$name} Header Script
   (defined below), in the <head> tag.

   The script below should define a variable, {$varprefix}channel. This variable
   should contain the name of the 'virtual directory' of the site.

   For example, if you are on the football summary page of the sports section
   of a news site, the following should be included:
     var {$varprefix}channel = '",

    'Publisher JS Channel Script Comment 2' => "/sports/football';
   Conversely, if you are on the home page of the site, the variable should be:
     var {$varprefix}channel = '",

    'Publisher JS Channel Script Comment 3' => "';
-->",

    'Publisher JS Header Script Comment' => "
<!-- {$name} Header Script

   Generated with {$name} v" . OA_VERSION . "

   Include this script below the {$name} Channel Scipt (but still
   in the <head> tag) of every page on your site.

   NOTE: This script does not change for any page on your site, so it may be
       more efficient to include it as a .js file rather than putting the
       entire text on every page. For example, if you cut and paste the code
       below and store it in a file called 'openads.js', the code below should
       call the script:

   <script type='text/javascript' src='openads.js'></script>
-->",

    'Publisher JS Ad Tag Script(s) Comment' => "
<!-- {$name} Ad Tag Script(s)

   Generated with {$name} v" . OA_VERSION . "

   The following are the script(s) for each ad tag. There are a couple of items to watch out for:

   1. Each tag has a different zone number (var 1), and a different key value (var 2). If the
      key value is the same for any two zone tags, the clickthrough URL may not work correctly.
   2. Each tag has a <noscript> section. If this tag is on an SSL page, change the
      'http://{$conf['webpath']['delivery']}/...' to 'https://{$conf['webpath']['deliverySSL']}/...'
      Note that the <noscript> section cannot dynamically choose between SSL and non-SSL.
   3. The <noscript> section will only show image banners. There is no width or height in
      these banners, so if you want these tags to allocate space for the ad before it shows,
      you need to add this information to the <img> tag.
   4. If you do not want to deal with the intricities of the <noscript> section, delete the
      tag (from <noscript>... to </noscript>). On average, the <noscript> tag is called from
      less than 1% of internet users.
