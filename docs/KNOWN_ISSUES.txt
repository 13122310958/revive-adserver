Please see http://trac.openads.org/ for the latest known bugs. The following
is a list of the major features that aren't in Max, as opposed to bugs that
have been found.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

- Max v0.3 is undergoing major surgery to keywords. If you use keywords,
  it is NOT advisable to use this build, as support is incomplete.

  (Basically, keywords are becoming categories, which will have
  similar behaviour to keywords. Some additional features will include
  being able to select from one or more categories -- much like
  selecting zones -- and the ability to see the volume of impressions
  for a given category before linking an ad to the category. In
  addition, there will be full support for SQL-like queries when using
  direct selection.  What this means is that parentheses are handled
  in addition to other direct selection criteria, and some of the
  syntax is changed to be more 'industry standard'.  Full documentation
  on direct selection will arrive when the new category support is
  complete.)

- Incomplete DAL (Data Access Layer) API for the user interface. Porting
  to other databases is welcome, but please discuss your porting ideas
  and efforts on the forums to ensure that effort isn't duplicated, and
  to help fit your porting in with our future plans for the DAL.

- Preferences don't cascade.

  (If the admin user sets preferences, and then creates an agency, the
  agency gets the admin user's preferences. However, if the admin user
  then changes preferences, and the agency has not set their own
  preference, they agency should get the new admin preference. They
  dont.)

- The version of PEAR::Config used in Max has been patched, but the
  patch has not yet been accepted by the maintainers yet. As a result,
  the version of PEAR::Config should not be updated.

- The version of PEAR::Cache_Lite used in Max has been patched, but the
  patch has not yet been accepted by the maintainers yet. As a result,
  the version of PEAR::Cache_Lite should not be updated.

- The version of PEAR::DB used in Max has been patched, but the
  patch has not yet been accepted by the maintainers yet. As a result,
  updates to PEAR::DB could be unstable, although the issue has only
  been replicated in a development environment.

- The version of PEAR::Date used in Max has been patched. See
  http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=2338.

- The test suite won't completely work in PHP 5, due to the way mock
  objects work in Simpltest.
